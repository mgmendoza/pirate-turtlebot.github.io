            <b>Project Description</b>
            <br><br>
             Pirate Turtlebot is a project created for the Final Project of EECS C206 course at UC Berkeley. In this project we combine different components of robotics: sensing, planning, and navigation.
             The goal is to teach a turtlebot to find an object inside an environment. The environment and the location
             of the object to find will be unknown to the turtlebot. The locations of the obstacles will also vary every
             time we command the turtlebot to find the object. The turtlebot should be able to navigate the environment
             and avoid obstacles to find the object of interest. Once the turtle has found the object, it will stop and send
             a message indicating it has completed the task.
